            <li class="two_wide bottom_left_90">Currents was recorded, produced, and mixed by Kevin Parker at his beachside home studio in Fremantle, Western Australia. The two-room studio contained a minimal amount of equipment: "a ramshackle drum kit, a guitar covered in duct tape and some battered vintage synths.” Parker likened his small setup to an airplane cockpit.</li>
            <li class="top_left_90">At the 2015 ARIA Music Awards Currents was awarded Best Rock Album and Album of the Year, and "Let It Happen" was nominated for Best Pop Release.</li>
